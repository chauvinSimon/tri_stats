# :books: DATA

Data are collected from the [Triathlon.org API](https://developers.triathlon.org/docs/triathlon-api-overview).

> "The **Triathlon.org API Platform** allows access to the entire [Triathlon.org](https://triathlon.org/) infrastructure and data"

**Race results** are processed as followed:
- **Year**: from `2009` (start of the world-series) to mid-`2024`, just after the Paris Olympics.
- **Event**: only **`world-cups`**, **`world-series`** (called **WTCS**) and **`games related events`** (Commonwealth, Olympics and Olympic test events).
- **Distance**: only **`sprint`** (`750 - 20 - 5`) and **`olympic`** (also called "standard": `1500 - 40 - 10`) formats.
- **Minimum number of finishers**: `25`.
- :warning: **IMPORTANT**: How to **summarize** all split-times of one race?
  - For each leg (`swim`, `t1`, `bike`, `t2`, `run`), **an average of `5` times** is computed.
  - Specifically, **the `5`-th to `9`-th best times** in **each sport** are used to compute this average.
  - This **choice is arbitrary** but, as explained below, **relevant for my goal**: _"Analysing the **general competitive field** in **each sport**"._
  - Other settings, e.g. top-1, top-3, top-10 and top-50, could also yield valuable insights, by adjusting a few parameters in the [provided scripts](#computer-code).
  - Notably, the **[PACES](#stopwatch-paces) and [LEVEL OVER THE YEARS](#spiral_calendar-level-over-years) sections** include **top-3 and top-10 analyses** as well. :medal_sports:

---

Why consider **split-times** based on the **ranking in each sport**?
- The split times of the **finish-top-10 athletes** can vary greatly depending on the **race scenario**:
  - For instance, a race might feature a **strong breakaway group of swimmers** reaching T2 with a significant lead, filling the top-10 positions.
  - In the same race, a large pack might arrive at T2 together, with the **strongest runners** then dominating the overall finish.
  - See **[this dedicated section](#dart-race-scenario)** for an **analysis of race scenarios**.
- On the other hand, considering the **ranking in each sport** allows for more **consistent and reliable comparisons** across races.

---

Why consider the **`5`-th to `9`-th best times**?
- To **mitigate outliers**:
  - **Outstanding swimmers, riders, or runners** might **miss a race** due to injury, scheduling conflicts, or other reasons, or they might have **unusually good or bad performances**.
    - Example: In the [2024 World Triathlon Cup Chengdu ( :cn: )](https://triathlon.org/events/event/2024_world_triathlon_cup_chengdu), Therese Feuersinger ( :austria: ) [exited the water](https://youtu.be/WVCUotrmyqY?si=EBgAs7FLYr8uSKxS&t=128) with a **[~50s](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2024_world_triathlon_cup_chengdu/630187) advance**. Considering her swim time, in an e.g. **top-5 average**, is **not appropriate to get a reliable picture of the general level**.
  - Conversely, the `5`-th to `9`-th times are usually denser, providing a **more robust representation** of the **general competitive field**.
- Against **strategic variability** among top performers:
  - The top-4 athletes might engage in **strategic tactics** on the **run**, such as testing each other or waiting for a final sprint, leading to **varying performances**.
    - Similarly, a top athlete may [**slow down** to celebrate a secured win](https://youtu.be/XMa5Soyx498?si=mR0m4P5DcYQFjg87&t=192) or [**push hard** for gold in a close race](https://youtu.be/zTFx6ha7Kos?si=hPv60RpJjL__v9CT&t=7), leading to **significantly different run times**.
  - Conversely, I believe athletes ranked `5`-th to `9`-th are more likely to **give their all without strategic calculations**, resulting in **more robust and consistent comparative times across races**.

---

What about the data quality?
- [World Triathlon](https://triathlon.org) puts efforts to uniform/standardize race reports and race timings.
- But some **manual cleaning** is required.
  - Some information, such as the permission of **wearing wetsuit**, is often missing.
  - Also, I could not find any way to **access the rankings of past years** via the [API](https://developers.triathlon.org/reference/ranking-detail).
- Obviously, **variations in distances**, weather conditions, athlete levels and scenarios make **comparisons between race difficult**.
  - Fortunately, the **number of races** is large enough to smooth out these variations and provide interesting insights.
- **Comparing swim-times** can be tricky, not just because the **distances vary** between events, but also because the **positions of timing mats** are not consistent.
  - Most mats are placed directly at the **exit of the water**, while others are located at the entrance of transition area, which can be **hundreds of meters further**.
  - Future results should be more consistent: World Triathlon is currently working on **standardising placement** of timing mats for all to be at **swim exit** as well as **T-In**.

# :question: THREE SPORTS

This section:
- Investigates the statement: _"swim, bike and run account each for **one third of the total duration**"_.
- Analyses some transition data: T1 and T2.

|                                          ![sport_proportion.png](res/sport_proportion.png)                                           | 
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| *Proportion of `swim`, `t1`, `bike`, `t2` and `run` in the overall race duration. For `women`/`men` and `sprint`/`olympic` formats.* |

Clearly **not 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3**!
- During a sprint format, women spend **twice as much time running (run+t1+t2) as they do swimming**.
- Athletes spend more than **three times longer on their bikes** than in the water.
- The proportion of the three sports remains similar between **sprint and olympic** formats.
  - The proportion of transition time is almost halved: **transitions are fixed durations** while the **race time doubles** from sprint to olympic.
- Women spend **less _relative_ time** on the swim but more on the run.
  - This observation is consistent with the [section on "Women vs Men"](#couple-women-vs-men).

Why **1.5+40+10** as a format?
- The format was [allegedly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon) introduced by the producers of the **U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS)** ( :us: ) in the **mid-1980s**
- According to [this article by the Bass Lake triathlon](https://www.basslaketri.com/history):
- _"A need was seen to **standardize the distances** and make them more in **sync with each individual sport**. USTS is credited with inventing the distances of the **modern day Olympic distance triathlon**. For the swim, 1500 meters was chosen because it is the **standard** long distance competitive swimming event. For the bike, USTS chose **40 kilometers because it was the standard solo time trial distance** in bike racing. And the choice for the run was the **standard road distance of 10 km**. Note that the distances were **not chosen to be symmetrical** nor were they in direct ratio to Ironman distances."_

**Drafting** is allowed on bike.
- Otherwise, gaps would probably be much larger, and probably the **bike skills would become much more decisive**.
- I could not find **when the drafting was first allowed** on elite races.
  - In the first ITU world championship in [1989 in Avignon ( :fr: )](https://triathlon.org/results/result/1989_avignon_itu_triathlon_world_championships), drafting [seems to be banned](https://youtu.be/RLmuXOGXQSU?t=1756).
  - **Banning drafting** seems nowadays complicated, considering the **density of the swim level**. Individual starts, e.g. every minute or so like during cycling time-trials, would be an option, and would give the **bike** section a **much higher importance**.  

**T1 and T2 represent a tiny part** of the overall racing time, yet they are **crucial**!
- E.g. to catch a good bunch at bike.

Comparing to **other triathlon formats**:
- Gustav Iden won the IRONMAN world championships in 2022 with the following times.
- "00:48:23" (3.8k), "4:11:06" (180k), "2:36:15" (42k), which represents:
  - **10.6%** swim
  - **55.1%** bike
  - **34.3%** run
- I.e. **More run** and **less swim**, which was expected from the distances: 3.8-180-42 compared to 1.5-40-10.

_(using Men data)_

#### T1

The duration of **T1** depends the **distance between the water and the transition area**, as well as on the **position of the timing mats**.
- E.g. when the swim exit happens on a sand beach (Mooloolaba ( :australia: ) , Huatulco ( :mexico: ), Hy-Vee ( :us: )), **timing mats are rarely placed directly on the sand**, but instead further, close to the transition area.
- Short T1 are often related to **unusually long swim times**: the best swim time 19:14 at Hy-Vee ( :us: ) 2010, and 22 min at Mooloolaba ( :australia: ) 2012!
  - That is **a shame**: in such cases **swim split times are incorrect**!
  - Mooloolaba ( :australia: ) has apparently **corrected** the position of the timing mats: the fastest T1 in 2015 was **01:15** (against **00:13** in 2012).

|  T1   |                                                                           EVENT                                                                            |

#### T2

The duration of T2 is mainly related to the **size of the transition area** (impacted by the number of participants) and to the position of the timing mats.
- Variations are smaller than for T1.

#### T1+T2

On average, T1+T2 takes **01:11** (men) and **01:18** (women).
- As mentioned for T1, **very short times** are mainly due to **wrong positions of the timing mats after the swim**: they are placed at the entrance of the transition area **instead of at the water exit**.
- Longer T1+T2 means athletes must **run more distance** to reach their bikes / shoes.
  - In Montreal ( :canada: ) 2023, it was 02:13: **more than one minute than usual**.
  - For a sprint format, this is **substantial**: compared to the 15:05 average men's 5k, this long transition makes the **run 7% longer**!

| T1+T2 |                                                                     EVENT                                                                     | DISTANCe |

# :stopwatch: PACES

It is worth recalling the [data](#books-data) settings:

- Year: from `2009` to mid-`2024`.
- Event: only **`world-cups`**, **`world-series`** (called **WTCS**) and **`games related events`**.
- Distance: only **`sprint`** and **`olympic`** formats.
- At least `25` finishers.
- :warning: **IMPORTANT:** for each leg of a race (`swim`, `bike`, `run`), **an average of `5` times** is computed, using the **`5`-th to `9`-th best times of the leg**.

**Sprint vs olympic** format:
- :swimmer: Swim **paces are almost identical** for 750m and 1500m: about **1s / 100m** difference.
- :bicyclist: There is **less than 1km/h difference** between the 20k and 40k bike.
- :runner: The 10k run requires **7s/km more** than the 5k.

The next section analyses the time differences between **women's and men's** performance.

# :couple: WOMEN VS MEN

The difference in percent is computed with:

```
diff_in_percent = (time_w - time_m) / time_m

I.e.
time_w = (1 + diff_in_percent) * time_m
```

This percentage says **_"by how much are women slower than men"_**.
- To know _"by how much are men faster"_, use `diff_in_percent / (1 + diff_in_percent)`.

Findings:
- :swimmer: The **swim** is the sport where the **relative difference** between women and men is the **smallest**.
  - Swimming is highly **technique-oriented**.
  - Women often excel in technical sports because these **rely less on raw strength** and more on skill, coordination, and efficiency.
  - Women and men have **different buoyancy**, as explained by Maria Francesca Piacentini, in [this episode](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts392/) (at 19:00) of the [triathlon show podcast](https://scientifictriathlon.com/podcast/).
  - As reported by [this 2019 article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334664495_Sex_Difference_in_Triathlon_Performance) by Romuald Lepers: _"Elite female athletes generally have **7–12% more body fat** than males (Fleck, 1983; Heydenreich et al., 2017). As fat is buoyant in water, **women are less penalized than men in swimming** than they are within **terrestrial events** such as cycling and running. Male triathletes also possess a **larger muscle mass**, greater **muscular strength** and **lower relative body fat** than female triathletes (Knechtle et al., 2010a)."_
- :runner: The **run** is where the difference is the **largest**.
  - Men typically have **greater muscle mass** and **aerobic capacity**, which can provide an advantage in endurance activities like running.
- :straight_ruler: The **standard deviation** is **higher for swim and lower for run**.
  - Because **swim conditions (wind, current, temperature) can vary** and athletes may follow non-straight swim lines leading to larger swim distances?
- :chart_with_downwards_trend: The **w/m difference has not significantly reduced** on the years, except for the **run leg of the sprint-format races (-0.13 % / year)**.
  - Note: Probably some **data processing should be applied** to the [line fitting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html).
    - E.g. to account for the very low number of points during the covid pandemic?
  - In WTCS and games-related events, the **w/m swim gap has reduced (-0.11 % / year)** as well.

These **percentages can be compared** with those of **swim, bike or run competitions**:

**`diff_percent = (time_w - time_m) / time_m`** is computed for a **couple of events** taken individually.

#### Focus on the swim: :swimmer:

|                             ![wm_swim.png](res/wm_swim.png)                             | 
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| *By how much swim women slower, with / without wetsuit? :swimmer: :one_piece_swimsuit:* |

:bulb: **FINDING**:
- The **women/men time difference** can be considered **constant**, **regardless of the distance** (sprint / olympic) and **the equipment** (wetsuit or not): **women swim ~8.8% slower**.
- This finding is consistent with [Vleck et al., 2011](https://www.triathlon.org/uploads/docs/Proceedings_I_World_Conference_of_Science_in_Triathlon.pdf).
- This result will be used in a [subsequent section](#penguin-wetsuit-benefit) to determine the **benefit provided by the wetsuit**.

---

---

# :swimmer: SWIM GAPS

This section tries to answer the question **_"Should worse swimmers be happy when the wetsuit is allowed?"_**.
- My **_a priori_ reflexion** was:
  - The wetsuit makes everyone swim faster.
  - => The **swim takes less time**.
  - => => **Gaps are smaller**.
  - => => => **Worse swimmers are happy**.

Approach:
- For each race, the gap between the **5-9th first swimmers** and **5-9th last swimmers** is computed.
- These **gaps are split into two groups**: `with-wetsuit` and `without-wetsuit`.
- The **averages of both group** are compared to determine **if the wetsuit makes swim gaps smaller or larger**. 

|                          ![swim_gaps.png](res/swim_gaps.png)                           | 
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| *Comparing **average gaps between good and "bad" swimmers** with and without wetsuit.* |

:bulb: **FINDINGS**:
- **Variations in the swim-pack length** between **event with-wetsuit and without-wetsuit** are **very small**.
- There is **no evidence** that worse swimmers should be happy about the wetsuit.
  - The **wetsuit even tends to stretch the swim pack**, especially for women. 
  - To be honest, I would have **expected the opposite!**

**POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION #1**:
- Wetsuits are typically worn in **cold waters**, often in **seas and oceans**, where waves can make swimming more challenging, potentially spreading out the pack.
- However, there are many examples of sea and ocean swims that occur without wetsuits!
- Therefore, I would **dismiss this hypothesis**.

**POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION #2**:
- True, the **swim is shorter in time**.
- But gaps **do not significantly reduce** because the **benefit provided by the wetsuit differs** between good and worse swimmers:
  - For **5-9th** top swimmer: **5.4%**.
  - For **20-24th** top swimmer: **5.3%**.
  - For last **9-5th** top swimmer: **4.9%**.
  - More details on this derivation can be found in the [dedicated section](#penguin-wetsuit-benefit).
- In other words, despite the shorter swim duration, **gaps do not reduce** because **top swimmers gain more benefits** from the wetsuit.

**QUESTION**:
- Would the wetsuit enable the **slowest swimmers** (last 9-5th) to **catch the good swimmers** (first 5-9th)?
  - On the olympic format, the **gap is about 50s and 45s** without wetsuit, while the fast women and men swim [on average in 19:30 and 17:57](#stopwatch-paces).
  - A **4.9% improvement** for the slowest swimmers represent `0.049 * (19:30 + 0:50) =` **60s**, and  `0.049 * (17:57 + 0:45) =` **55s**.
  - Conclusion: the slowest swimmers with the **benefit of the wetsuit** would be **~10s faster that the good swimmers** without.

Considering the **"front-to-middle" distance** (using the **20-24th** swimming times instead of the last 5-9th), results looks similar: **No significant gap reduction**.
- `men`+`sprint`+`no_wetsuit` may suffer from outliers: gaps at Tiszaújváros ( :hungary: ) 2013 and 2016 were larger than 33s.

|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| *Same computation as above, this time with gaps between 5-9th to **20-24th** swimmers.* |

---

When considering **world-series events only**, the opposite trend occurs: the **wetsuit tends to reduce the swim gaps**.
- However, as noted earlier, **variations are very small**, indicating that **no significant effect of the wetsuit on swim gaps can be concluded**.

# :penguin: WETSUIT BENEFIT

This section tries to **estimate the benefit (in percent) offered by the wetsuit**, defined as

```
improve_percent = (time_no_wetsuit - time_wetsuit) / time_no_wetsuit

I.e.
time_with_wetsuit = (1 - improve_percent) * time_without_wetsuit
```

Reminder:
- The scope here is **elite triathletes**, going **5-9th** out of water on top World Triathlon events.
- Results would certainly **differ for beginners** and hobby triathletes.

The idea of the **derivation** is as follows:
- **Women [have been found](#focus-on-the-swim-swimmer) to swim on average ~8.8% slower than men**, with the **same equipment**.
- With examples where **women had the wetsuit**, but **men did not**, one can:
  - 1- Estimate, from the men's time, the **time women WOULD HAVE done without the wetsuit** (thanks to the ~8.8% rule).
  - 2- Compare the **women's time with wetsuit** (measured) with the **women's time without** (computed in 1-).
  - 3- Deduce the **advantage provided by the wetsuit** for the women.
  - 4- Note that `improve_percent` should be the **same for women and men** (because of the **constant** ~8.8% difference given the **same equipment**).

- Advantages of this method:
  - **Proper environment**: data comes from **real races**, as opposed to studies in 50m or even 25m pools.
  - **No need to know the exact swim distance**: what matters is that men and women swim the **exact same course**. This assumption is **reasonable** because the buoys should not move between the two races.
  - **Data-based**: the 8.8% should be **robust** since it leverages results from many races (230 events).
  - **Low cost**: all the data is available online for free.

- Limitations:
  - The **swim conditions** are not guaranteed to be equal.
    - For instance in [Cagliari ( :it: ) 2024](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2024_world_triathlon_championship_series_cagliari) the **seawater** was [more **choppy** :ocean: for the men](https://youtu.be/-Su5kpPz0hY?t=79) than [for the women](https://youtu.be/vFV-kB8727I&t=69s).
    - This might explain why the gap between men and women was slightly smaller than average.
  - The **limited number of events** where the "women-with / men-without" scenario occurs.
    - Only five races fit this scenario, but the **variability is low**: `std = 0.5%`.

# VARIABLES
  swim_w:             time of women. no wetsuit.
  swim_m:             time of men. no wetsuit.
  swim_w_wet:         time of women. with wetsuit.
  
  improve_percent:    advantate (in percent) brought by the wetsuit. UNKNOWN.
  wm_percent:         relative delay of women over men assuming same equipment.
  wm_percent_w_fast:  relative delay when women have wetsuit, but men do not.

# FORMULA
  would W have not had wetsuit:
    (1)  `swim_w * (1 - improve_percent) = swim_w_wet`  =>  `swim_w = swim_w_wet / (1 - improve_percent)` 
  and this time would be related to swim_m:
    (2)  `swim_w = swim_m * (1 + wm_percent)`
  using (1) == (2):
    (3)  `swim_w_wet = swim_m * (1 + wm_percent) * (1 - improve_percent)`
  
  on the other hand:
    (4)  `swim_w_wet = swim_m * (1 + wm_percent_w_fast)`
  
  using (4) == (3):
    (5)  `(1 + wm_percent) * (1 - improve_percent) = (1 + wm_percent_w_fast)`
  re-written:
         `(1 - improve_percent) = (1 + wm_percent_w_fast) / (1 + wm_percent)`
  hence
         `improve_percent = 1 - (1 + wm_percent_w_fast) / (1 + wm_percent)`

# EXAMPLE
  [wm_percent = 8.8%]
  [wm_percent_w_fast = 2.9%]
  => improve_percent = 1 - (1+0.029)/(1+0.088) = 5.4%

| *Estimating the benefit brought by the wetsuit, using results of races where women swam with but men without.* |

:bulb: **FINDING**:
- The **wetsuit brings an advantage of ~5.4%** to top swimmers (5th-9th).
- Put differently, top swimmers (top 5-9) swim **~5.7% slower without wetsuit**.
  - `0.054 / (1-0.054) = 0.057`.

:warning: **CRITICISMS AND IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**:
- **1) Uncertainty**:
  - How to **account for uncertainties** in `wm_percent_w_fast` and `wm_percent` in the `improve_percent = 1 - (1 + wm_percent_w_fast) / (1 + wm_percent)` formula?
    - So far, the [**standard deviations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) were computed (`± 3.0%` and `± 0.5%`), telling **how spread out** the observed w/m-swim-diff percentages are:
      - `wm_percent = 8.8% ± 3.0%`.
      - `wm_percent_w_fast = 2.9% ± 0.5%`.
      - Concretely, in the case of `wm_percent`, `± 3.0%` [can be interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) as: _"~68% of the observed w/m-swim-diff percentages lie between 8.8%-3% and 8.8%+3%"._
    - I am not sure, but from what I understood, in order to produce a **confidence interval** for `improve_percent`, the **[standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) (`SE`)** should be used instead:
      - `SE(wm_percent) = 3.0% / sqrt(230) = 0.2%`.
      - `SE(wm_percent_w_fast) = 0.5% / sqrt(5) = 0.2%`.
  - In statistics, this question is known as [Propagation of Uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty).
    - Approach #1 (simple): perform calculations using the extremes of the error intervals to see where `improve_percent` falls.
      - Here, applying the combinations (-0.2%, -0.2%), (-0.2%, +0.2%), (+0.2%, -0.2%) and (+0.2%, +0.2%) to (`wm_percent = 8.8%`, `wm_percent_w_fast = 2.9%`).
      - This results in the interval **`improve_percent = 5.4%` with `0.4%` standard error**.
    - Approach #2 (using [partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Simplification)):
      - Using [this tool](https://statpages.info/erpropgt.html), I obtain **`improve_percent = 5.4%` with `0.3%` standard error**.
- **2) Events consistency**:
  - `wm_percent_w_fast = 2.9%` was computed from **five** _"women-with-wetsuit, men-without"_ examples that **all have the following properties**: **WTCS** and **olympic-format**.
    - The five **venues** are: Yokohama ( :jp: ) (twice), Cagliari ( :it: ), Stockholm ( :sweden: ) and Edmonton ( :canada: ).
  - In contrast, `wm_percent = 8.8%` was obtained by considering **all** the sprint- and olympic-format WCTS, world-cups and games-related events since 2009, totaling **230 events**.
    - This is inconsistent.
  - Instead, `wm_percent` should be estimated considering events with **similar swim conditions** as those for `wm_percent_w_fast`.
    - Idea #1: Only consider events with the **same format** (olympic) and **event-category** (WTCS).
      - This leads to a **slightly lower estimate** (`wm_percent = 8.1% ± 2.4%`), resulting in an **`improve_percent` closer to 4.8%**.
    - Idea #2: Further restrict Idea #1 (same format and event-category), by considering only with the **same venues**.
      - The four venues mentioned have **hosted multiple** olympic-WTCS: 20 times, from which **15** had women and men sharing the same equipment for the swim.
      - This gives `wm_percent = 7.4% ± 1.6%` (`SE = 1.6/sqrt(15) = 0.4%`), leading to **`improve_percent = 4.2%` with `0.3%` standard error**.
- **3) Additional examples**:
  - Several **other events** feature the _"women-with / men-without"_ scenario.
    - Tongyeong ( :kr: ) ([2011](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2011_tongyeong_itu_triathlon_world_cup), [2014](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2014_tongyeong_itu_triathlon_world_cup), [2016](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2016_tongyeong_itu_triathlon_world_cup)), [Arzachena ( :it: ) (2020)](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2020_arzachena_itu_triathlon_world_cup), [Haeundae ( :kr: ) (2021)](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2021_world_triathlon_cup_haeundae) are **world-cups** events, so they have not been included.
    - [Sydney ( :australia: ) (2012)](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2012_itu_world_triathlon_sydney),  despite being a WTCS, was excluded due to an **unusual w/m swim difference**: women swam 10.1% slower than men, even with the wetsuit advantage.
  - It would be valuable to include events with the **opposite scenario**: _"women-without / men-with"_.
    - I have found only one: [New Plymouth ( :new_zealand: ) 2017](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2017_new_plymouth_itu_triathlon_world_cup).
  - Future events may **provide additional examples** to further refine the estimate.

### :mortar_board: Literature review

Here are **some findings of related scientific works**:

- [This 2019 research by Gay et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30958047/) asked 33 swimmers to perform 2×400-m maximal front crawl in a 25-m swimming pool, with wetsuit and with swimsuit. Participants were good swimmers, but not as fast as ITU elite athletes: **1:27 / 100m** average on the 400m with swimsuit.
  - The **wetsuit** allows for a **~6% improvement**.
  - Interestingly: _"Swimmers **reduced stroke rate** and **increased stroke length** (by 4%) to benefit from the hydrodynamic reduction of the wetsuit and increase their swimming efficiency."_
- [This 2022 meta study by Gay et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-9488/2/4/16) concludes from 26 studies, a _"**3.2–12.9% velocity increments** in distances ranging from 25 to 1500 m"_ for the **full-body wetsuit**.
  - The range is broad: it depends on many factors such as the **profile of the swimmer** (age, level, triathlete or swimmer), the **swimming conditions** (temperature, 25m pool vs open water) and the **wetsuit** itself.
  - [This interview of Ana Gay in triathlete.com](https://www.triathlete.com/gear/swim/how-much-faster-does-a-wetsuit-make-you-swim/) gives a good introduction to her study.
- In [this episode by scientifictriathlon.com](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts392/), [Maria Francesca Piacentini](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria-Francesca-Piacentini) mentions some of her research on wetsuit, and **claims 6% to 11% improvements**.
  - Apart from the time reduction, her team found that **wetsuit usage** can make athletes **feel less fatigued**: during the [2x7x200m tests](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366991271_The_Effects_of_a_Wetsuit_on_Biomechanical_Physiological_and_Perceptual_Variables_in_Experienced_Triathletes), the [**stroke index**](https://blog.tritonwear.com/interpreting-to-improving-stroke-index#:~:text=It's%20called%20the%20Stroke%20Index,dig%20further%20into%20this%20shortly.) and the **stroke length** significantly **decreased in the swimsuit** condition, whereas they remained relatively **stable in the wetsuit condition**.
- [This article from sports-performance-bulletin](https://www.sportsperformancebulletin.com/training/triathlon-clothing-the-benefits-of-wearing-a-wetsuit) reports **improvements by 3% to 7%**.
  - Sources are not explicitly referenced, but the article probably mentions [this 1995 research by Chatard et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15406796_Wet_suit_effect_A_comparison_between_competitive_swimmers_and_triathletes) which apart from computing improvements, shows that the **impact of the wetsuit** is very different for **competitive swimmers than for competitive triathletes**.

The **5.4% improvement** for top swimmer (5th-9th) **derived from the World Triathlon data** seems **compatible** with the findings of these research publications.

### Is the wetsuit worth for 300m?

When they can choose, **pro athletes decide to use the wetsuit** for **~300m swim**, e.g. during **mixed team relay**. Examples:
  - [2018 Nottingham ( :gb: ) ](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2018_itu_world_triathlon_mixed_relay_series_nottingham/323321): [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4LHN6GeTF4).
  - [2022 Leeds ( :gb: )](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2022_world_triathlon_championship_series_leeds/550671): [pic1](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/163472/tomz2553.jpg) and [pic2](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/163472/tomz2448.jpg).
  - [2023 Sunderland ( :gb: ) ](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_championship_series_sunderland/576189): [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xufIoKMYlLo). (Here the wetsuit was mandatory: 13.7°C water :cold_face:)

**_Is this decision sound?_**

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand - 🐧 <strong>Answering the question <i>"wetsuit for 300m?"</i></strong></summary>

Over **300m** a **wetsuit should save ~12s** (derivation below).
- Most of the time, athletes spend **just a bit less than 6s in transition to remove their wetsuit**, and put it correctly into their box.
  - Maybe 4s or 5s when everything goes well? But up to 10s when one leg does not want to get out.
- **Conclusion**: the **overall time gain of wearing the wetsuit for 300m seems to be positive: around 6s**.
  - Apart from time saving, wetsuits offer additional benefits: temperature **comfort** and probably saving some **energy in the legs**. Also, athletes may a couple of seconds to breath while removing it at T1.
- Conversely, assuming an **overall 6s spent** for removal, wearing a **wetsuit is beneficial above ~150m** for top athletes. Under ~150m, time is lost overall.

**Derivation:** The time for a 300m swim is probably **around 3:30 - 4:00**.
- Here are some swim-times measured for 300m, without wetsuit:
  - The 5-th **man** out of water was at **~3:35** at [2024 Hamburg ( :de: )](https://youtu.be/WyfYD2wsHPg?t=76) during the first leg.
  - The 5-th **man** out of water was at **~3:37** at [2023 Hamburg ( :de: )](https://youtu.be/nJ4sm5ULXj8?t=1322) during the first leg.
  - The 5-th **man** was at **~3:41** at [2023 Super-Sprint Hamburg ( :de: )](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_sprint_relay_championships_hamburg/582516) .
  - The 5-th **women** was at **~3:46** at [2021 Tokyo ( :jp: )](https://youtu.be/oQQEa_je2Vg?t=777).
  - The 5-th **women** was at **~3:58** at [2018 Hamburg ( :de: )](https://youtu.be/oAwzJnX44Yg?t=42).
  - The 5-th **woman** was at **~4:05** at [2023 Super-Sprint Hamburg ( :de: )](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_sprint_relay_championships_hamburg/582517).
- Variations occur depending on the **actual swim distance** (buoys positions) and the **position of the timing mat**.
- Considering the broad **range (3:30 - 4:00)** seems relevant.
  - For the (3:30 - 4:00) range, the **5.4% gain** offered by the wetsuit leads to a **~12s saving**.

The benefit of the wetsuit could be estimated with a second method (less reliable):

|:------------------------------------------------------------:| 
|   *Comparing duration of swims with and without wetsuit.*    |

The idea is to compare the **average swim durations**, **with-** and **without wetsuit**:
- `improve_percent = (time_no_wetsuit - time_wetsuit) / time_no_wetsuit`.
- This formula is applied to **four cases**: W-sprint, W-olympic, M-sprint, M-olympic. And results are written in the title of the above figure.
- Note how the **swim histograms** of the [:stopwatch: PACES](#stopwatch-paces) section **reveals two distinct modes**: **with-** (in violet, with lower times) and **without wetsuit** (larger times).  

Outliers:
- The swim from [2012 Mooloolaba ITU Triathlon World Cup ( :australia: )](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2012_mooloolaba_itu_triathlon_world_cup) has been dropped, see the previous section on [T1](#T1).
- The **slowest swim** in the **olympic format**, for both men and women, occurred during **Paris 2024 Olympic Games** ( :fr: ).

:warning: **CRITICISMS**.
- This method incorporates **more data**, but yields **less reliable** results to the following factors:
  - :straight_ruler: **Swim course distances** vary between races.
  - :stopwatch: **Timing methods** (e.g., timing mat locations) are **not always consistent**.
- For exemple:
  - The **difference** between the fastest and the slowest `sprint`+`men`+`same-equipment` swim exceeds **2 minutes**.
    - Specifically, swim times at **Mooloolaba** ( :australia: ) are **unusually fast** considering the **absence of wetsuit**.
  - For `olympic`+`men`+`no-wetsuit`, the difference is **5:45**.
- Clearly, **swim distances** or **timing methods** vary between races, even when they are **labeled with the same format**.

# :dart: RACE SCENARIO

This section looks at the race dynamics of **WCTS and games-related events** (no world-cup).
- Based on the information **_"does a bunch manage to breakaway on the bike?"_** :bird:

To obtain this information, the **size** of the **front pack** at the **end of the bike** is estimated as follows:
- Compute, for each athlete, the cumulative times after the bike:
  - `start_to_t2 = swim + t1 + bike`.
- Identify which athlete enters T2 first: `min(start_to_t2)`.
- Count how many athletes enter T2 **`pack_duration_s`, e.g. 10s, or less** after this first athlete.
- This gives the **size of the front pack** at the **end of the bike**.

Note: A **breakaway** on the bike can happen:
- Either by **attack and escape from the main bike pack** (rare).
- Or **directly from the swim** (most common).
- It should be possible to automatically retrieve the **breakaway type** among the two, using the swim rank of athletes composing the breakaway. _(I have not done it)_.

Two additional pieces of information are retrieved:
- :trophy: **`winner_in_front_pack`**: was the **winner already in the leading group** at the end of the bike, or did she/he **come back on the run**?
- :athletic_shoe: **`is_best_runner_in_front_pack`**.

|       ![scenarios.png](res/scenarios.png)        | 
|:------------------------------------------------:| 
| *Size of the front pack at the end of the bike.* |

About the **number of finishers**:
- **~4.5 more** finishers in **men's** races.
  - The standard deviation is higher for women's race.
- **~3.5** more** finishers in **sprint format** races.
  - Because the olympic format is longer, weaker athletes are more likely to be caught and eliminated by being lapped?
- It would be interesting to know the **number of starters** as well.

On the **olympic** format, **men are more likely to break away**.
- Because they are stronger on the bike?
  - Georgia Taylor-Brown ( :gb: ), **one of the strongest rider** in the field, admits in [this video](https://youtu.be/8dvcwuT2T_8?t=1251): **_"I would love to be able to attack and stay away, but I do not have that power."_**
  - Probably bike is the sport among three where **top athletes will progress the most** in the future.
- At the same time, the **probability to win** for athletes from the front group is **much lower for men than for women**.

Small front packs, i.e. **small breakaways**, are more likely on the **olympic format**.
- Possibly because a **longer swim** leads to **larger gaps** at **T1**?
- On the other hand the bike is longer than for the sprint format, which **should give more time** for the other packs to catch up.

Below is a more complicated figure: the bars show the evolution of the average **first-pack size** over the years.

| ![scenarios_over_years.png](res/scenarios_over_years.png) | 
|:---------------------------------------------------------:| 
|        *Size of front bike pack, over the years.*         |

**Run-comebacks**, i.e. winning after not being in the front group after bike, are **rare**.
- Apart from 2013-2016 (the era of Gwen Jorgensen ( :us: )), **no comeback has happened on women's olympic races** and only a few on women's sprint format.
  - At the same time, the size of **front-pack had reduced until 2022** and was even very small for some recent years (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022).
  - Now, **top-women-swimmer** can **ride hard** and **run fast**.
- Helen Jenkins ( :gb: ) explains in [this 2024 video](https://youtu.be/QwCUmvPCjw4?t=338): _"Women's races have definitely changed over the past few years. (...) **2021 was that breakaway era**. It definitely **comes back** to that **larger front group** over the last couple of years."_
  - That statement is perfectly **consistent** with the women's olympic bar plot.
- The **men's olympic races** follow a similar same trend: the **front group at T2 has, on average, never been as large**, as in 2023 and 2024.

### :runner: How often does the best runner win? :trophy:

| ![best_runner_wins.png](res/best_runner_wins.png) | 
|:-------------------------------------------------:| 
|       *How often does the best runner win?*       |

More than **2/3 races** are **won by the best runner**.
- This percentage is higher on the **sprint** than on the **olympic** format.
  - Probably because the swim is shorter: "good-runner-but-bad-swimmer"s are **less likely to miss the front group** on the bike.
- This percentage could be:
  - Higher, if the winner does not slow down and **"enjoy" the last 100m run**, and instead sprints until the end, as most athletes behind have to. Example: [Leonie Periault ( :fr: )](https://youtu.be/XMa5Soyx498?t=209) in [2024 Yokohama ( :jp: )](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_championship_series_yokohama1/627955).
  - Lower, if good runners who, at T2, are already too far for the win, **get as motivated** as the athletes at the front, and give their best possible run.
- The percentage **drops to 50%** when considering **world-cup** events only. Why?
  - Because athletes are **not as complete as on WTCS**?
  - There are **more "good-runner-but-bad-swimmer"s** who miss the front group on the bike, while good swimmers are not top runners?

Why are there not **more breakaways** on the bike?
- The **mini areo TT bars** [have been banned](https://www.slowtwitch.com/Lifestyle/An_Athlete_s_Perspective_on_2022_World_Triathlon_Rules_8217.html) in 2023.
- Bike courses are **mostly flat**.
  - Events often take place on flat coasts, near to a sea, or in **flat big cities**.
  - [Joel Filliol](https://joelfilliol.com/) ( :canada: :scotland: ) shares insights in [this TTS podcast (around 43:00)](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts409/) about bike courses that allow for a break to stay away.
- Because of **U-turns**.
  - As Michel Hidalgo ( :brazil: ) [explains in this video](https://youtu.be/8dvcwuT2T_8?t=780), **U-turns can be detrimental for breakaways**.
- Athletes may prefer to conserve energy for the **run segment**.
  - Valid of strong runners.
  - But for others? Maybe it is **worth more** to **conserve energy by drafting** and try to make top-20 with a good run, rather than risk a breakaway that might be caught, be burnt and **come back home without any prize money or qualification points**?
- Not enough bike power?
  - Possibly, given these athletes need to be strong in swim and run as well, they cannot **afford having massive legs**.

# :rocket: SPRINT FINISH

This section studies the **time gap between the winner and the second**.

|  ![sprint_finish.png](res/sprint_finish.png)  | 
|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| *Time gap between the winner and the second.* |

- In men's races, **17%** (sprint format) and **10%** (olympic) are **won by a sprint finish**, occurring **50% more often** than in women's races.
- Women's races offer **examples of wins by very large margins**.

|                                                   ![sprint_finish_over_years.png](res/sprint_finish_over_years.png)                                                    | 
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| *Time gap between the winner and the second, over years. And the proportion of events with a contested win finish (less than 3s difference between first and second).* |

Gaps **between the winner and the second** are on average:
- **~Twice as large** in **olympic** formats compared to **sprint** formats.
- **~Twice as large** for **women** compared to **men**.

It has been a long time since a **women's olympic race** was won by a **sprint**.

By the way, [World Triathlon rules](https://www.triathlon.org/uploads/docs/World-Triathlon_Competition-Rules_2024_20240416.pdf) that the **win must be contested**:
- Triathletes **should not** _"finish in a **contrived tie situation where no effort** to separate the finish times has been made"._
- At Tokyo ( :jp: ) 2019, Jessica Learmonth ( :gb: ) and Georgia Taylor-Brown ( :gb: ) were **[disqualified after crossing line hand-in-hand](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/15/winning-triathletes-jess-learmonth-georgia-taylor-brown-disqualified-tokyo-hand-in-hand-triathlon)**.

In [this early-2024 video](https://youtu.be/iCpi2sUh6Ko?t=1838), **Vincent Luis** ( :fr: ) explains:

> "My running times are very similar to what I was doing in 2019-2020, when I was world champion. [...] It's just that **the level has gone up** [...]. I ran at **20km/h in Yokohama (2024)**. This is a pace that **5-6 years ago was enough to win some World Series**."

The above plots seem **consistent** with this statement. :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- The figures for women's and men's olympic-format show recent **improvements of the 10k run pace** (green bars) on **WTCS races**. For 2019 -> 2021 -> 2023, paces were:
  - `3:33 -> 3:28 -> 3:23` for women.
  - `3:06 -> 3:04 -> 2:59` for men.
- The `3:00 /km` pace mention by Luis was, in **2023**, **hardly enough to finish between `5`-th and `9`-th on WTCS men's races**.
- The same **`3:00 /km` was, in **2019**, probably enough to win a WTCS**, since the `5`-th to `9`-th places were about `3:06 /km` at that time.

---

In [this other 2024 video](https://youtu.be/5dyR4zNMsmA?t=840):
- **Alex Yee** ( :gb: ) mentions that the **run of 2012 London ( :gb: ) Olympics** is a reference: _"The run was held as the **best run that has ever been done in triathlon**"_.
- He explains: _"In the last season _(2023)_, we had a few races which came very close to that."_
- This statement seems also to be correct: on the run subplot of the men's olympic format figure, **`London 2012` was the fastest until 2023**.
- This [article from triathlon.org](https://www.triathlon.org/news/article/a_chance_for_history_breaking_down_the_stats_of_past_olympic_games), released **just before Paris ( :fr: ) 2024**, confirms: _"Brownlee’s times (London ( :gb: ) 2012) will likely come under threat. Indeed, it seems highly likely that we could see the **first ever sub-29** and **sub-33** minute 10km times in an Olympic triathlon this summer."_
  - The 5-9th men **ran** at the 2024 Paris Olympics **much slower** that the year before for the **test event**.
  - Also, Alex Yee ( :gb: ) won in 2024 with a **29:49** run, compared to **29:00 in 2023**.
  - Because of the **heat** (the men's race started at **10:45 am** instead of 8:00 am)?
  - Or the fatigue caused by the very long swim?
  - Or was the **run course longer** in 2024? In this case the **women's run time improvement** would be even more **impressive**: Beth Potter ( :gb: ) did 32:57 in 2023, compared to **32:42** for Cassandre Beaugrand ( :fr: ) in 2024, who run faster than 30% of men finishers (15 / 50)!

**Yokohama** :jp:
- The event took place **13 times** between 2009 and 2024 in an **olympic** format.
  - I do not know if the courses have changed.
  - But if not, the **comparison** should be **very relevant**.
- **Run times have decreased in the last five editions.** :athletic_shoe: 
  - Leading to the best ever times in [2024](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_championship_series_yokohama1/627954).
- It is interesting to note that runs were particularly **good on olympics years** ([2012](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2012_itu_world_triathlon_yokohama/7817), [2016](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2016_itu_world_triathlon_yokohama/280982), [2021](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2021_world_triathlon_yokohama/452691), [2024](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_championship_series_yokohama1/627955)), especially for **women**.
  - Can it be that this race (usually happening early in the season) was used as **qualification criteria** or as a rehearsal, and therefore attracting very fit and motivated athletes?

---

**Hamburg** :de:
- The event took place **12 times** between 2009 and 2024 in a **sprint** format.
- **Run times** have been constant until [**2024**](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2024_world_triathlon_championship_series_hamburg/627964), where a **clear improvement** can be seen.
  - The 2024 race was used by many athletes as a **final repetition** before the Olympics. But still, the **improvement is huge**.
  - Can it be that the 2024 run course was shorter? Indeed, the [2024 result page](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2024_world_triathlon_championship_series_hamburg/627964) indicates `Run 4.905km (2 laps)` for 2024, compared to `Run 5km (2 laps)` for [2022](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2022_world_triathlon_championship_series_hamburg/546857).

Impact of **carbon plate running shoes**? :athletic_shoe:
- The Nike Vaporfly [came out in **2017**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Vaporfly_and_Tokyo_2020_Olympics_controversy#:~:text=The%20Nike%20Vaporfly%20first%20came,new%20series%20of%20running%20shoes).
- As for Yokohama ( :jp: ), the running paces have been **constantly improving on WTCS since 2017-2018**.
  - Running times were **already good before 2014**.
  - But **since 2021, paces have never been so low.**
- **Carbon plate technology could be one of the main factors** explaining this improvement.
  - But how to explain that running performances on **world-cups** have not followed the same trend?

---

The **bike(s)** :bike:
- On olympic format, bike times have been **drastically improving** (ignoring covid 2020 year) over the past 6 years, especially for the men.
- Can it be due to **tech innovations?**
- Maybe the level has gone up: **it is no longer just about being a good swimmer and an excellent runner?**
- Maybe some athletes tend to **take more risks** on the bike, sometimes reckless as reports Vincent Luis ( :fr: ) in [this interview](https://youtu.be/iCpi2sUh6Ko?si=PFnh-Cgg24PQTSJZ&t=1250).

---

**World-cup vs WTCS** :trophy:
- Apart for 2018, the **running level** is consistently **higher in WTCS than in world-cups**.
- Which could be expected since **WTCS are so much selective**.

---

The swim of [2024 Paris ( :fr: ) Olympics](https://triathlon.org/results/result/paris_2024_olympic_games/655047) was very though because of the **current** on the way back:
- 20:26 (**01:22** /100m) for men.
- 22:33 (**01:30** /100m) for women.

**Care** is needed when comparing **swim times**:
- In the WTCS (green bars), **women's times appear to have reached historic lows**, while 2024 men's times are the third **slowest** since 2009.
- This is likely because, in the two 2024 olympic WTCS events considered (Yokohama ( :jp: ) and Cagliari  ( :it: )), **women swam with wetsuits while men did not**.

---

**Criticisms** :warning:
- Not all events have **identical distances** and conditions.
  - However, **averaging many events** _(the number below the year on the x-axis)_, with multiple venues **repeating every year**, helps to **mitigate this variability**.
- Swim :swimmer:
  - Distances can vary based on **buoy positions**.
  - Differences in **water conditions** (e.g. rough sea, current) can also significantly affect swim times, making comparisons challenging.
  - Last but not least, the **wetsuit** may be allowed or not.  
- Bike :bicyclist:
  - Weather conditions, particularly **wind** and **rain**, can influence bike times.
  - Variations in **course profiles (hilly vs. flat)** can make direct comparisons of bike times unfair.
- Run :running:
  - Run times are generally **more comparable** as World Triathlon run courses tend to be **predominantly flat**, reducing variability.

- :ocean: 80% of the recorded **water** temperatures are between **16.4 and 26.9 °C**.
  - (**Mean: 21.5 °C**, SD: 3.9 °C, Min: 13.8 °C, Max: 31.0 °C)
- :parasol_on_ground: 80% of the recorded **air** temperatures are between **17.0 and 29.6 °C**.
  - (**Mean: 23.3 °C**, SD: 4.9 °C, Min: 11.0 °C, Max: 34.0 °C)

---

**Several limitations** should be considered:
- **Incomplete data:** Over half of the events lack temperature data, limiting the analysis's comprehensiveness.
- **Pre-race measurements:** Measurements are typically **taken before the event**.
  - Depending on the **race timetable**, the **actual temperature** experienced during the race can be lower or higher than the **reported temperature**.
  - _"Water temperature must be taken **one hour** prior to the start of the event on competition day. It must be taken at the middle of the course and in two other areas on the swim course, at a **depth of 60 cm**."_
  - Air temperatures are likely **recorded before the race** as well, potentially leading to **significant temperature increases** by the time athletes begin the run.
  - For instance, the air temperature for the [men's race (10:45 am)](https://triathlon.org/results/result/paris_2024_olympic_games/655047) at Paris 2024 ( :fr: ) is reported at **23.9 °C**, while it was [closer to **28 °C** during the run](https://www.infoclimat.fr/observations-meteo/archives/31/juillet/2024/paris-montsouris/07156.html). 
- **Humidity Impact:** While humidity could significantly affect running performance, its values are **not reported**.
- Last but not least, **swim and run courses vary in distance**, and water conditions (e.g., waves, salinity) also differ between events, making **comparisons challenging**.

:warning: Given these **limitations**, especially the variation in course distances, **conclusions should be drawn with caution**.

### :ocean: Water temperatures and swim times

| ![temperatures_water.png](res/temperatures_water.png) | 
|:-----------------------------------------------------:| 
|          *Water temperature and swim times.*          |

The [women's race](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2021_world_triathlon_cup_haeundae/454064) at [Haeundae ( :kr: ) (2021)](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2021_world_triathlon_cup_haeundae) is excluded due to an **inconsistency with the 20°C wetsuit rule**:
- The race report notes: _"Water temperature 21.3ºC. Air temperature 15.4º C. Wetsuits allowed."_
- The [2024 rule book](https://www.triathlon.org/uploads/docs/World-Triathlon_Competition-Rules_2024_20240416.pdf) states in section 4.4.b. that _"when the water temperature is at or below 22ºC and the **air temperature** is at or below **15ºC**, then **the value of the water temperature will be adjusted**."_
  - For instance: Air at 15°C and water at 22°C -> The **water temperature is adjusted** at 18.5°C -> Wetsuit allowed.
  - It is possible that the 15°C threshold was higher in 2021, leading to the discrepancy.

Swim appears **slightly faster in water temperatures below 20°C**, which is particularly visible in the two "olympic" sub-plots.
- Likely because **wetsuits are permitted** at these lower temperatures.
- Further research could analyse the **impact of temperature on swim performance** (see already [Gay et al, 2021](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1481-8473)), and try to determine the **optimal water temperature range** for races, with and without wetsuits.

|         *Air temperature and run times.*          |

A **2nd degree fit** is applied on the scatter plot using [`seaborn.regplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.regplot.html).
- It suggests a trend where **higher temperatures** correlate with **slower running paces**.
- While no definitive "optimal" temperature can be reliably determined, this trend **aligns** with both [research findings](https://www.outsideonline.com/health/running/racing/race-strategy/how-much-does-heat-slow-your-race-pace/) and **personal experiences** ( :hot_face: ).
- It also underscores the **importance of hydration and cooling strategies**, such as the use of **[cooling headbands](https://conecta.tec.mx/en/news/national/entrepreneurs/goodbye-heat-mexican-creates-band-cool-down-olympic-athletes)**.

## Athlete seasons

The following plots represent the **seasons** (columns) of **50 athletes** (rows).
- The top-50 of **[`World Triathlon Championship Series Rankings`](https://triathlon.org/rankings/world_triathlon_championship_series/male)** is used.
- The [`World Triathlon Rankings`](https://triathlon.org/rankings/world_triathlon_rankings/male) would have been preferred since it takes both **world-cups** and **world-series** into consideration.
  - Unfortunately, I could not find any archive for 2018, 2020, 2021, 2023. :disappointed:

|               *Seasons of the top-50 athletes. Men.*                |

|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
|              *Seasons of the top-50 athletes. Women.*               |

**Top athletes** seem to **prefer world series over world cups** (more red than blue in the top rows).
- Probably because WTCS events offer **more points** and **prize money**.
- Some athletes do not race in any world cup events (light blue background).

Regarding the **competition season**: from 2009 to 2019, it **became longer**.
- The 2009 WTCS season started in May, but from 2015-2019, it began in early March.
- In 2023, the WTCS season was **6.5 months long**, compared to **4.2 months in 2009**.
- The number of world cup events increased significantly during this period: from **3 in 2009 to 13 in 2019**.
  - The **2018 world cup** season lasted **9 months**.
- The **COVID-19 pandemic halted this trend**, although 2023 seems similar to 2019.
  - The ranking process became complicated: e.g., some 2021 races were considered for the 2022 ranking.

Regarding the **athletes' season**: it **follows** the competition season.
- Their World Triathlon season extended **from 130 days in 2009** to **200 days in 2023**.
- On average, athletes raced **10 times in 2019** and **2023**, compared to **6 times in 2009**.

The results found (**number of races** and **season duration**) are **lower bounds**:
- Athletes participate in **other formats besides World Triathlon olympic and sprint** races.
  - For instance, the [French Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_de_Triathlon) was very popular in the 2010s.
  - Some athletes are racing the [supertri](https://supertri.com/) and **Ironman 70.3** formats as well.
- Their competition season is probably longer, including **indoor races** in the **winter**.

### :ticket: Olympics qualification

The **Olympics competition** has **55 spots**, with a limit of **3 athletes per nations**.

Considering nations with a high percentage of athletes in top-50, let's estimate **how many athletes miss the Olympics** because of **the _'max-3-rule'_**:
- **Women:**
  - :us: : ~11.0% => **~3.0** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :gb: : ~10.9% => **~3.0** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :australia: : ~10.1% => **~2.6** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :jp: : ~8.0% => **~1.4** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :de: : ~7.6% => **~1.2** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :new_zealand: : ~5.7% => ~0.1 top-50 athlete rejected. :disappointed:
- **Men:**
  - :fr: : ~9.6% => **~2.3** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :gb: : ~8.4% => **~1.6** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :de: : ~8.1% => **~1.5** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :australia: : ~7.7% => **~1.2** top-50 athletes rejected. :disappointed:
  - :es: : ~7.0% => ~0.9 top-50 athlete rejected. :disappointed:
  - :us: : ~6.1% => ~0.4 top-50 athlete rejected. :disappointed:

The estimated **numbers of rejections** are probably **lower bounds**:
- World Triathlon **limits the number of athletes per nation** for its races too.
  - As a result, some strong athletes, such as US women, cannot participate in important World Triathlon races, and thus do not gain points for the ranking.

The percentages are **averages** since 2009. Some years, they can be **much higher**:
- For instance, **8 women in the top-50** (**16.0%**) for:
  - :us: [2015](https://triathlon.org/rankings/itu_world_triathlon_series_2015/female) (a pre-olympics year), with **6 top-30** and the **4th athlete was ranked 16th**.
  - :us: [2016](https://triathlon.org/rankings/itu_world_triathlon_series_2016/female), with **6 top-20**.
  - :australia: [2017](https://triathlon.org/rankings/itu_world_triathlon_series_2017/female).
  - :gb: [2021](https://triathlon.org/rankings/world_triathlon_championship_series_2021/female), with **8 top-30**.
    - The same year, :us: had **5 athletes in the top-12**.

It is no wonder that some athletes **change nationality** to try to qualify for the Olympics.

# :baby: AGE

|          ![ages.png](res/ages.png)           | 
|:--------------------------------------------:| 
| *Age of athletes ranked 5th-9th over years.* |

Athletes finishing 5th-9th are, on average, **26.3 to 27.7** years old.
- Ages are **similar** for **women and men**.
- Athletes are **slightly older** in the **olympic format** compared to the sprint format: about **1 year difference**.
  - _I would have expected a larger difference._
- There are some small variations, but **no significant trends over the years**.

# :checkered_flag: AGE OF LAST RACE

|  ![ages_of_last_race.png](res/ages_of_last_race.png)  | 
|:-----------------------------------------------------:| 
| *Age of last world-cup, world-series or major games.* |

The **average age** of the last race is **similar for women and men**: around **31 years**.

The **distribution is broad** (`~4y std`), because there are **various reasons** for ending a World Triathlon sprint- and olympic-distance top career, such as:
- **Age limit** for elite sport.
- Transitioning to **longer-distance** triathlons
- **Injury**.
- **Personal reasons**, such as pregnancy or changing careers.

Some **extreme values**:
- **`<25` years**:
  - Hollie Avil ( :gb: ): **21y**, 13 races.
  - Kirsten Nuyes ( :netherlands: ): **22y**, 21 races.
  - Ellen Pennock ( :canada: ): **23y**, 17 races.
  - Hanna Philippin ( :de: ): **24y**, 32 races.
  - Marc Austin ( :gb: ): **24y**, 25 races.
  - Sophia Saller ( :de: ): **24y**, 26 races.
  - Oliver Freeman ( :gb: ): **24y**, 20 races.
  - Raphael Montoya ( :fr: ): **24y**, 21 races.
- **`>38` years**:
  - Magali Di Marco Messmer ( :switzerland: ): **39y**, 52 races.
  - Greg Bennett ( :australia: ): **39y**, 70 races.
  - Hunter Kemper ( :us: ): **39y**, 65 races.
  - Kate Allen ( :austria: ): **39y**, 24 races.
  - Samantha Warriner ( :new_zealand: ): **42y**, 48 races.
  - Kiyomi Niwata ( :jp: ): **43y**, 96 races.

# :date: MONTH OF BIRTH

For this section and the next one about [Body mass index](#weight_lifting-BODY-MASS-INDEX), a **larger dataset** is used:
- **All athletes** part of a **non-para ranking**, and aged between 15 and 45 years, are considered.
  - The **ranking categories** defined by World Triathlon can be found [here](https://developers.triathlon.org/reference/rankings-api-overview).
- Leading to a total of **3,439 unique athletes**, including 1,382 women and 2,057 men.

The **month-of-birth** distribution of the athletes is compared to **two reference distributions**:
- Reference #1: **Uniform** month-of-birth distribution.
  - It could be **expected** that each month accounts for **`1/12 = 8.3%`** of the births.
- Reference #2: Birth data collected by the **United Nation**: [data.un.org](https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode%3A55).
  - Birth data of people aged between 20 and 30 years are considered, leading to **over 230 million entries**.
  - It could be **expected** that World Triathlon (formerly **ITU**) and **UN** month-of-birth distributions **match**.

> _Can these discrepancies be due to differences between the two datasets (ITU and UN), such as the geographical origin of the births?_

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand - 🌍 <strong>Continent analysis.</strong></summary>

The **continent distributions** differ between the World Triathlon and the UN datasets:

- **ITU dataset:** Europe is predominant (~59%). Asia  (~13%) and North America (~11%) follow.
- **UN dataset:** Asia (~34%), Europe (29%) and North America (24%) form a more uniform top-3.

| *Quarter-of-birth distribution, by continent (normalized).* |

**Conclusion:**
- The continents mainly represented in the two datasets (ITU and UN) share **very similar month-of-birth and quarter-of-birth distributions**.
- Therefore, the difference in continent distributions **does not explain the discrepancy** in month-of-birth and quarter-of-birth distributions between the ITU and UN datasets.

The UN and ITU datasets share the **same average age (25)**, but the **ITU age distribution is not uniform**, unlike the UN one.
- Importance sampling could be applied to the UN dataset to make the two distributions match, but I would be very surprised if that had an **impact on the overall conclusion**.

> _Is the difference between ITU and UN month- and quarter-of-birth distributions **statistically significant**?_

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand - 🧮 <strong>Statistical test.</strong></summary>

**3,439 birth entries** have been collected (**"observed"**) from the World Triathlon (formerly **ITU**) data.
- A priori there is **no link** between the **quarter-of-birth** and the **fact of being a high-level triathlete**.
- Therefore, it can be **assumed** that the ITU observations **follow the UN distribution**.

From the UN distribution, the **expected** number of births for each quarter is computed:

|    |  OBSERVED (ITU)  |  EXPECTED (UN)  |
|:--:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Q1 |       987        |     854.443     |
| Q2 |       859        |     845.248     |
| Q3 |       820        |     893.717     |
| Q4 |       773        |     845.592     |

The number of births in the **two columns look very different**: more observations than expected for `Q1`, fewer for `Q3` and `Q4`.
- The situation is similar to the case of a **6-sided dice**, which is **suspected to be biased**. :game_die:
  - After rolling the die many times and counting each outcome, one can ask:
  - _Is just due to **randomness** or is it because the **dice is unfair**?_

Back to our problem:
- How to **quantify the deviation** between the two columns?

|    |  OBSERVED (ITU)  |  EXPECTED (UN)  |   DIFF   |  DIFF^2  |  DIFF^2 / EXPECTED  |
|:--:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| Q1 |       987        |     854.443     | 132.557  | 17571.3  |       20.5646       |
| Q2 |       859        |     845.248     | 13.7516  | 189.106  |      0.223728       |
| Q3 |       820        |     893.717     | -73.7166 | 5434.14  |       6.08039       |
| Q4 |       773        |     845.592     | -72.5916 | 5269.54  |       6.23178       |

One can compute the **differences between columns**, square them to ensure they are positive, normalize them and **sum the results**:
- `SUM OF [DIFF^2 / EXPECTED]` = `20.5646 + 0.2237 + 6.0804 + 6.2318` = **`33.10`**
- It `33.10` large? What does it mean? What can be concluded?

There is a mathematical formula that, given this computed number (`33.10`), answers the following question:
- _What is the **probability of observing such a discrepancy (`33.10`)** or an even larger one, **assuming** that the **ITU data should follow the UN** quarter-of-birth distribution?_
- In other words: _How likely is it that **the observed deviation** is due to **random chance**?_

For `33.10`, the formula gives `p = 0.0000003`, i.e. `0.00003%`.

**Conclusion:**
- The extremely low probability (`0.00003%`) indicates that the **observed differences** in quarters-of-birth among World Triathlon athletes are **highly unlikely to be due to random chance**.
- Therefore, the observed differences are **statistically significant**.
- This suggests a **systematic deviation from the expected UN distribution**.
- In other words, the quarters-of-birth of high-level triathletes **do not align with the general population** as represented by the UN distribution.

:warning: These findings **do NOT indicate** that _"World Triathlon athletes born in January **are more performant** than others born in later months"_!
- This birth-of-month analysis rather shows that **someone born earlier** in one year **is MORE LIKELY TO BECOME PRO TRIATHLETE** than one born later in the same year.

Here is one **possible explanation**:
- Kids born on **January, 1st and December 31st** of the same year compete in the **same age category**.
- For example, at the age of 12, a 12-month difference represents **10% of their lifetime**.
- A 12-year kid born in January could, in theory, be ~10% **physically more developed (in terms of strength and stamina)** than one born in December.
- This **edge** could give an advantage to kids and teenagers born in the first months of a year during their early **races in youth categories**.
- They are **more likely** to **perform well, stand out, gain experience, and get selected for international competitions**, eventually **becoming professional**. :trophy:
  - Similar to a snowball effect. :cyclone:
- This phenomenon, known as [**relative age effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect), was also observed on young Spanish triathletes by [Ferriz et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/17/6792) in 2020.

# :weight_lifting: BODY MASS INDEX

> "The [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) is defined as the **body mass** divided by the **square of the body height**, and is expressed in units of kg/m^2"

To maximize the amount of data, **all athletes registered with World Triathlon** are considered (not just those participating in world-cups and world-series).
- In total, **504 athletes** aged between 15 and 53 (average is 27) are included.

| ![bmi.png](res/bmi.png) | 
|:-----------------------:| 
|   *Body Mass Index.*    |

| ![weight_height.png](res/weight_height.png) | 
|:-------------------------------------------:| 
|           *Weights and Heights.*            |


First, is the BMI a **relevant metric** here? No!
- It is useful for public health, providing a quick and simple measure to identify **trends in obesity and underweight conditions**.
- But **it does not measure fitness levels, physical endurance, strength, flexibility, or other aspects of physical health**.
- Many athletes may have a high BMI due to increased **muscle mass**, yet they are fit and healthy.

Second, there is no enough data.
- **Only 14%** of athletes registered with World Triathlon have valid weight and height information (504 out of 3560).
- Most athletes did not input their dimensions.
- Sometimes for privacy reasons, e.g. the entry for Kristian Blummenfelt's ( :norway: ) weight: _"None of your business"_.

Third, some data may be outdated.
- The body weight that can **vary during a career** (many athletes enter the database as juniors) or even during a season.

Alternative metrics such as _Body Fat Percentage_ or _Muscle Mass Percentage_ would be more appropriate for **fitness assessment**.

If **not much can be concluded**, comparing oneself to the distributions can still be interesting.

# :scroll: CONCLUSION

## :bulb: IDEAS

Here are **some ideas** for **data to explore**:

#### :mag: 1) MORE DETAILED RACES ANALYSES

As mentioned by Alex Yee in [this video](https://youtu.be/zoYeVlM28J4?t=689):

> "You are doing a **full gas effort** at the start of a race which is **2 hours long**. If you told somebody to do that on a marathon, they would laugh in your face."

World Triathlon data provides **a single time** for **each leg**: `swim`, `t1`, `bike`, `t2`, `run`. There is no detail about the pace evolution **during each segment**. For instance:
- Fast swim start to reach the first buoy.
- Fast bike start to break away or catch a pack.
- Fast run start - _I have never really understood the benefit compared to a steady effort._
- Fast run finish.

Some events, such as [Paris Olympics](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/results/triathlon/men-s-individual/fnl-000100--), offer **detailed results with lap times**.
- It is for instance very instructive to **compare the runs** of Alex Yee ( :gb: ), Hayden Wilde ( :new_zealand: ) and Léo Bergère ( :fr: ).
- The first two completed the **first 1050m in `2:42`**.
- Alex Yee then "slowed down" to ~`3:00` for the following three laps, while Léo Bergère was **a bit more regular**: `2:49`, `2:56`, `3:01`, `2:54`.
- Such data should be very interesting to analyse.

In addition to **paces**, it would be interesting to access **data** such as:
- Swim **stroke rate**.
- Bike **power** and cadence.
- Run **cadence**.
- Run **maximum speed** during the sprint.
- **Heart rate**.
- ...
- For comparison, heart rate information from some athletes is shown in UCI mountain-bike world-cups videos.

**Activity trackers** would be needed for these recordings, but athletes **rarely wear them** while racing, making **swim** and **run data recording** difficult.
- _This is also something I find puzzling: such data should be **invaluable for elite athletes**, shouldn't it?_ 
  - I first thought it was **forbidden** during the swim. [**World Triathlon rules**](https://www.triathlon.org/about/downloads/category/competition_rules) are **not very clear** to me:
    - _"Athletes may not use **communication devices** of any type, including but not limited to cell phones, **smart watches** ..."._
    - _"Propulsion devices that create an advantage for the athlete, or a risk to others, are forbidden."_ _Could a sport-watch increase the propulsion surface or be harmful to others in case of contact?_
    - On the other hand, the **swim section** states: _"**Electronic devices may be used** in the **competition** unless they are distracting the athlete from paying full attention to their surroundings"_.
- There are a few exceptions, where devices are used either for **assisting athletes in pacing their runs** or for **recording data**, such as:
  - Cassandre Beaugrand ( :fr: ) [seen **holding some device** during the Paris Olympics](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/pictures/S730frivHusOjCabDZvitrL_1z8/0x106:1024x682/1328x747/filters:format(avif):quality(50)/2024/07/31/000-36776ev-66aa06e0cbb4b034364713.jpg) and [wearing one on her wrist at Gagliari 2024 ( :it: ), where Beth Potter ( :gb: ) also appeared to be using one](https://youtu.be/vFV-kB8727I?t=189). _Possibly to pace her 10k run?_
  - Hayden Wilde ( :new_zealand: ), [spotted using **a device** during the Paris Olympics](https://www.triathlon.org/uploads/hrgalleries/191104/awag1132_paris2024__medium.jpg) _(discussion [here](https://the5krunner.com/2024/08/01/alex-yee-paris-gold-with-coros-dura-plus-what-was-haydn-wilde-looking-at-during-the-run/))_, and at [Gagliari 2023 ( :it: )](https://triathlon.org/results/result/2023_world_triathlon_championship_series_cagliari/586471) where [he did not wear a watch during the swim](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/174957/tzaf5501.jpg?w=1140&auto=format), but [**had one for the run**](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/174957/tomz0840.jpg?w=1140&auto=format) _(possibly attached with [an elastic band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyliQoQskww&t=3)?)_, which [he **stopped at the finish line**](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/174957/tomz0987.jpg?w=1140&auto=format).
  - The Australian team ( :australia: ) at [Hamburg 2017 ( :de: )](https://triathlon.org/events/event/2017_hamburg_itu_triathlon_mixed_relay_world_championships) with **sensors taped to their backs**: [image 1](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/59304654a9f11b7e563cdab4e0e892d6?width=1024), [image 2](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/112903/170716-itu-hamburg-team-web-msj-022.jpg?w=1140&auto=format), [image 3](https://triathlon-uploads.imgix.net/webgalleries/112903/170716-itu-hamburg-team-web-msj-047.jpg?w=800&). _What did they measure?_
- The **GPS features** of activity trackers could also provide **more precise estimations of the course distances**.
  - Especially for the **run**, and even for the **swim, to compare the trajectories**.
- Some athletes seem to use **heart rate monitor (HRM) belts**, such as [Kristian Blummenfeld ( :norway: ) at Tokyo 2021 ( :jp: )](https://triathlon.org/news/article/kristian_blummenfelt_crowned_tokyo_2020_olympic_champion).
  - But as far as I know, no **stroke rate**, **cadence** or **GPS** data can be recorded with these devices.

**Strava** could be used to retrieve activities:
- Many athletes **publish** their activities there, either their races (often limited to the bike section) or training sessions.
- However, as mentioned, almost **no swim or run** information is recorded during **races**.

#### :shopping: 2) EQUIPMENT CHOICE

What is the **best wetsuit**? What are the **fastest running shoes**?
- There are already some tests and reports conducted by researchers.
- However, I believe that **examining athletes' preferences** would provide **more reliable and valuable** results.

Not all athletes are **sponsored** by swimming or running brands.
- Therefore, many have the **freedom** to **experiment, compare, and choose** the equipment **they believe will enhance their performance**.
- As an example, one could track how many athletes wore Asics, Adidas, Nike, New Balance, etc., at major events, noting the models used, and **exclude those provided by sponsors**.

_I recall reading about a similar project but can no longer find the reference._

#### :moneybag: 3) MONEY

It would be interesting to investigate the **financial aspects** of the competitions, such as:
- The **prize money** for the different World Triathlon race categories.
- The event **registration costs**.
- Eventually, to estimate **from which rank an athlete can make a descent living**. (Of course, sponsoring and federation support also play a role).

#### :spaghetti: 4) MISCELLANEOUS

- Analyse the **correlation** between **transition ranking** and **finish ranking**.
  - Especially for T2.
- Compare **WTCS** and **world-cups** more thoroughly.
  - These two event-categories have been combined in several sections of this document to **increase the dataset size** and hopefully improve statistical significance.
  - However, in some cases this approach may not be optimal, and it would be insightful to explore the differences between these categories.
  - The level is **generally higher on world series**, but there are some exceptions: **World cups** like [2020 Arzachena ( :it: )](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2020_arzachena_itu_triathlon_world_cup/352548), [2014 New Plymouth ( :new_zealand: )](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2014_new_plymouth_itu_triathlon_world_cup/264274), [2014 Mooloolaba ( :australia: )](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2014_mooloolaba_itu_triathlon_world_cup/264271) and **[2009](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2009_hy-vee_itu_triathlon_elite_cup/5187)** and [2010 **Des Moines ( :us: )**](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2010_hy-vee_itu_triathlon_elite_cup/5613) **likely matched** the **competition level** of the average World Triathlon Series events. In fact, they were probably more competitive than some WTCS races held during Olympic years, such as [2012 Sydney ( :australia: )](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2012_itu_world_triathlon_sydney/7599), [2016 Cape Town ( :south_africa: )](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2016_itu_world_triathlon_cape_town/280877), [2021 Hamburg ( :de: )](https://www.triathlon.org/events/event/2021_world_triathlon_hamburg), [2024 Hamburg ( :de: )](https://www.triathlon.org/results/result/2024_world_triathlon_championship_series_hamburg/627964).
  - Compared to the early 2010s, world-cups _(possibly due to their location, date, and low prize money?)_ appear to have been largely abandoned by top athletes in favor of newer race formats, such as the [supertri](https://supertri.com/), the [French Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_de_Triathlon) and even Ironman races.
- The [arbitrary decision to focus on the **top 5-9**](#books-data) was made to capture a stable and consistent **representation of the general competitive field**.
  - However, examining the **top performance** (e.g. top-1 or top-3) or using a **broader range** could also yield valuable insights.
- Conduct advanced analyses of **cycling performances** would be interesting.
  - Additional data may be required: drawing conclusions based solely on **bike split times** is challenging, due to the influence of **drafting** and pack dynamics.
- Investigate the impact of **swim conditions** on swim performance and race dynamics.
  - Including **water temperature**, presence of **waves**, and **salinity**.
- Take a closer look at the **critical start of the bike segment**.
  - For example: _Given a lag at T1, how likely is it to catch the first group?_
- Understand the system of **penalties** and their impact on race dynamics.
  - The 2024 Paris Olympics ( :fr: ) saw a surprising number of penalties: **[6 women out of 51](https://triathlon.org/results/result/paris_2024_olympic_games/655048) and [10 men out of 50](https://triathlon.org/results/result/paris_2024_olympic_games/655047)** received a **15s penalty**.
  - Before focusing on gaining seconds, some athletes may need to **prioritize avoiding penalties**, such as by **correctly timing their dive** and making sure to **place their helmet inside** the transition box.
- Analyze the **trajectory** of successful elite athletes.
  - _How did they perform as juniors, and how did they **progress** from **junior** to **U23** to **elite**?_
  - One could also ask: _One junior athlete excels in swimming, another one in running. Which is more likely to become an Elite and perform in this category?_
- Try to estimate the **level of a race**.
  - Propose a **formula** based on metrics such as the ranking of participating athletes and, if available, their results in this race.
    - Extensions include evaluation of individual race segments (swim, bike, run), and **athlete scoring**.
  - Potential **pre-race and post-race applications**:
    - _What performance objectives should the **coach** set, considering the expected race difficulty?_
    - _Should a **federation** select an athlete for this event based on the competitiveness of the start list?_
    - _How strong are the best swimmers for this race? Who would be the optimal neighbours on the **start pontoon**?_
    - _How strong was this top-10 finish, given the competition level? Did an athlete **overperform or underperform** in a specific leg?_
    - _What are the most hotly contested races?_ With a formula like this, I could **classify the races by level** and keep only the e.g. 100 most disputed for my analyses.
- ...

## :takeout_box: TAKEAWAYS

:warning: Most **summary numbers** given in this section are **AVERAGES**.
- For instance **race-averages** are computed from the 5th to 9th best times of **each leg**, and sometimes **averaged** over multiples years.

Here are some simplified **key takeaways**:
- :stopwatch: The three sports account for **16.4%** ( :swimmer: ), **53.1%** ( :bicyclist: ), **28.9%** ( :runner: ) of the overall time. Transitions for 1.1% and 0.5%.
- :athletic_shoe: While **swim and bike paces are similar** between sprint and olympic formats, the **10k run** requires **7 s/km** more than the 5k.
- :swimmer: Women swim at **1:18 / 100m**, men at **1:12 / 100m**.
- :bicyclist: Women ride **4 km/h slower**, at **37.4 km/h**, compared to men at **41.4 km/h**.
- :runner: Women run the 10k at **3:33 min/km** (3:26 for 5k), men at **3:07 min/km** (3:00 for 5k).
- :couple: **Women swim 8.8% slower** than men with the same equipment. They also **ride 10.6%** and **run 14.2%** slower.
- :chart_with_downwards_trend: The **women/men difference has not significantly reduced** on the years, except for the run leg of the sprint-format races (-0.13 % / year) and for the swim of WTCS (-11 % / year).
